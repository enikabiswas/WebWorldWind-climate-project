This project uses climate data from the world bank api to allow the user to see monthly and annual changes in temperature and precipitation in various countries that the user specifies using the interactive Web World Wind SDK platform from NASA Ames research center. 

The backend is written with Node.js + Express and MongoDB where the annual precipitation and temperature data is being stored. 

The frontend is written with the Express framework Handlebars and HTML and Javascript.
